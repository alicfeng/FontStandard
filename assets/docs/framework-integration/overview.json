It accomplishes this by using standardized web platform APIs that work across all modern browsers. Using the low-level component model that is provided by the browser (which all frameworks are built on) allows Stencil components to work inside of a framework or without one."],"\n",["p",null,"Stencil's integration with different frameworks is currently a work in progress. As Stencil matures, the goal is to make it easy to write standard web components which will compile to various output targets. This allows developers to stay aligned with the latest web standards while using a common API.

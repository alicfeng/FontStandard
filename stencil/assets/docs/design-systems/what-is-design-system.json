Its goal is to do one thing well while remaining abstract enough to allow for a variety of use cases. Developers can use them as building blocks to build new user experiences.

Often, multiple components are combined together in order to create a standardized user experience (UX). Their key benefit is intertwined: UX as well as developer experience (DX). After implementing patterns, users will understand the application better and accomplish their tasks faster. When the development team understands the proper way to use components together, software applications become easier to use.

The entire product development team is freed up to focus on what matters most: solving customer problems and delivering value.

Designers define a centralized “source of truth” for software application best practices, referenceable by anyone in a product organization. Developers no longer need to spend time rethinking how to build common app scenarios, such as application search or data table grids. When the business inevitably makes changes to the Design System, they can easily be applied to all projects. The end result is a better product for your users."]]}

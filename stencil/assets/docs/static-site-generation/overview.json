By doing so, developers can still use all the same APIs they're already familiar with, but they'll seemlessly work within a NodeJS environment too. This means developers often do not have to write code differently in how they're building components, but rather they focus only on writing one type of component, and coding it using the standards they already know. To reiterate, developers do not have to learn a new API for prerendering. It's just the same web APIs your components are already using."],"\n",["p",null,"Every component, machine and environment will perform differently, so it's difficult to provide a consistent benchmark.
